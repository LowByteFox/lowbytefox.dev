>Hi, I'm LowByteFox, I'm a (primarily) system level programmer, digital artist, content creator and a vtuber. I am (as of now) writing free & open-source software (FOSS) in my free time and have been for about 4 and half years, I also happen to draw from time to time, stream on Twitch as a vtuber (PNGTuber). I also happen to be a furry. My goal is to write simple, user friendly & re-usable software to make the world a better and simpler place.

## Interests
My main interests root in software engineering, I like writing code using `C`, `Zig` & `POSIX shell` scripts. I like UNIX-like operating systems such as `Linux`, `FreeBSD` & `OpenBSD`. I am familiar with [many more](/technologies) technologies. My favorite git service is [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/) and is a place I push my code to. You can find some projects I haven't transfered yet on my [Codeberg](#links) and [Github](#links).

I'm currently learning digital art with the help of [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), might get drawing tablet in the near future, for now I'm focusing on drawing lines.
